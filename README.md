# Individual project: Personal Portfolio platform

## Summary
I want to create a digital portfolio where all of you can see the projects I have been developing during my learning.  
Also, you will find information abaut me, my CV and abaut how to contact me.

## How it works
 
The objectives were to create a **landing page** that presents the web, and allow the acces to the rest of the pages: one for my biograph and CV, one for contact and, the last one, to see the projects I developed. 

- Using the principal buttons in the main page or the navigation menu, you can get into the rest pages.
- Biograph: Here the is button that lead to my Curriculum (Google Drive), and a sort description of me.
- Contact: In this section you will find several buttons, eachone related with one of my social networks.
- Projects: All of my finished projects are here. There is information abaut the page like the title, a description and the technologies I used.
  Using the icons right bellow the technologies you will be able to see the website and the repositorie here, in GitHub.
